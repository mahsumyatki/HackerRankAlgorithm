Consider an array of integers where all but one of the integers occur in pairs. In other words, every element occurs exactly twice except for one unique element. Find the unique element.

For example, given the array arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 2], you would return 3.

Sample Input 0

1
1

Sample Output 0

1

Explanation 0
The array only contains a single 1, so we print 1 as our answer.

Sample Input 1

3
1 1 2

Sample Output 1

2

Explanation 1
We have two 1's and one 2. We print 2, because that's the only unique element in the array.

Sample Input 2

5
0 0 1 2 1

Sample Output 2

2

Explanation 2
We have two 0's, two 1's, and one 2. We print 2, because that's the only unique element in the array.
